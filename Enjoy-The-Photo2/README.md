Bugs and Issues:
- the generator of uStory options sometimes produce words not digestible for query. MUST BE FIXED BEFORE V 1.1 RELEASE.

- in PhotoConteiner.tsx when opening Modal the icons should turn off, they do, but when closing the Modal, the ICONS TURN ON AGAIN. I tried to fix it, but I couldn't. I will try to fix it later.
